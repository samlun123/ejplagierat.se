    <h1>Book review: idiots breed idiots - Why men are no longer created equal</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The book Idiots breed idiots - Why men are no longer created equal, written by author Niklas Hageback, is a very informative book about genetics, intelligence, macroeconomics and eugenics; topics which are rarely discussed in such an emotionally stable manner as in this book. The book truly covers a broad spectrum of facts and ideas and each chapter ends with an extensive reference list in order to maintain an academic standard, something which is especially important when the topics being discussed are so sensitive. This paper will check the credibility of the information, related to the question of nature versus nurture, as presented in the book. Since the third chapter is the only one discussing this topic in depth, the other chapters will mostly be ignored.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>The book has 6 chapters:</strong><br>1. The history of eugenics<br>2. After world war 2<br>
        3. The current view<br>
        4. The strictly economic perspective<br>
        5. Why do civilizations collapse? A demographic perspective<br>
        6. Conclusions<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Summary of chapter 3</h3>
        <p>In the third chapter, the author describes what might be the future of eugenics: Genetic engineering and designer babies. After that, the concept of IQ is introduced to the reader, and the theory of there being different forms of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence, is quickly dissected as Hageback is very clear about IQ being “the single most effective metric for forecasting a number of socioeconomic factors, not only educational level, employment and income, but also extending to include crime, marital status, illegitimate children, physical and psychological ailments, and life expectancy.” Hageback also briefly discusses the groups belonging to different IQ-levels, what kind of lives they normally live and the problems they may face. Again, Hageback presents the idea that people live differently depending on their IQ. 
        <br><br>The middle part of the chapter discusses the question of nature versus nurture, genetics versus environment; which will be the focus of this study. Hageback’s main standpoint is that the answer has never been one or the other. Instead, his theory is that genetics sets the boundaries for how the environment can influence an individual: One cannot, for example, become a rocket scientist if he or she had a particularly difficult time keeping up in elementary school, since that is often due to hereditary factors.
        Finally, the last part of the third chapter discusses where the western world is going in terms of intelligence. Hageback explains how modern technology caused an increase in average IQ, something called the Flynn effect, which has slowed down, stopped and even started to reverse into the opposite: the Lynn effect, something caused by a negative correlation between intelligence and number of children.

        <h2>Asessment</h2>
        <p>Research on the topic of nature versus nurture has come a long way during the last decades. To illustrate this, here are two quotes from academic papers on the topic; the first one is from 1998 and the second one is from 2021.<br><br></p>
        <p>“Individual differences in personality traits have been found to be moderately to highly heritable”<br><br>

            “Behavioral genetic research has robustly shown that almost all traits that vary between humans are heritable. Indeed, a meta-analysis of twin studies on almost 18,000 human traits reported an average heritability of .49 (Polderman et al., 2015). Another metaanalysis specifically examining the heritability of personality traits on the basis of identical and non-identical twin data yielded a comparable estimate of .47 (Vukasović & Bratko, 2015), meaning that about 47% of population variance in personality involve genetic contributions, with the remaining personality differences primarily attributable to individual life experiences and error of measurement. When taking random and nonrandom error of measurement into account, the heritability estimates typically exceed .50 (Kandler & Papendick, 2017; Kandler, Richter, & Zapko-Willmes, 2017; Riemann, Angleitner, & Strelau, 1997). “<br><br>
            </p>
    <p>Here is another quote from an academic paper in 2011 casually explaining how intelligence is substantially heritable.
    <br><br></p>
    <p>“Intelligence is associated with important economic and health-related life outcomes. Despite substantial heritability (0.54) and confirmed polygenic nature, initial genetic studies were mostly underpowered.”<br><br></p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The meaning of the title Idiots Breed idiots - Why men are no longer created equal is that intelligence is heritable and humans are not born as blank slates. John Locke was wrong. This thesis, presented by Niklas Hageback, seems to be consistent with the limited amount of research, accessible to me for free, on the subject. Intelligence, along with almost all other traits with some variance within the human population, is heritable. Genetics play a bigger role than environment in determining the IQ of an individual.</p>

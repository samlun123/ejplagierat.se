    <h1>Podcast review: Is Germany OK?</h1>
    <p><u><strong>Introduction</strong></u><br>
        Germany is the second most populous country in Europe after Russia, making it the most influential country in the European Union. A single political party in Germany often has a lot more influence in the EU than all the parties combined of smaller member states, such as Sweden. It is therefore crucial as members of the EU that we have some reliable information about the German economy. <br>
            This is what the British Broadcasting Corporation recognized in 2019 when they made a programme called ‘Is Germany OK?’ as part of their podcast ‘The Inquiry’. We live in a world where the big media corporations such as the BBC constantly tells us to “trust the science”, but how accurate is the information in the podcast, really?<br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>Summary</strong></u><br>
        In the podcast ‘Is Germany OK?’ cCreated by the British Broadcasting corporation they, meaning the reporter and an ‘expert’, talk about the economic situation of Germany. Throughout the podcast they give a bit of history about Germany. They mention its unification in the 1800s, and its role in the reformation, in order to make a point about Germany being a nation of savers. They also talk about the economic recovery after the second world war and its modern economic model, which they say is mostly based on exports and has been ever since the US helped Germany recover after the war.<br>
            Then they move on to talk about the companies they say are running the German economy, and they give Volkswagen as the primary example of a German international corporation. They say Volkswagen were tricking tests to appear more eco-friendly, but since they got busted for this, the EU has looked into their testing, which has affected the company negatively. But it is still going well for Volkswagen.<br>
        Since this second part about Volkswagen is not as relevant for the German economy as the first part is, this assessment will only be about the first part of the podcast.<br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>Assessment</strong></u><br>
        <br>
        The following questions are all asked in the podcast<br>
        <br>
        How much did the Marshall plan contribute to the German post-war economic recovery?<br>
        While, in some areas, there is a direct correlation between the assistance that the Marshall plan provided and the post-war German economic recovery, for the most part, the Marshall Plan should be viewed as a catalyst which set off a chain of events, creating a favorable result for Germany. (Tarnoff, C. 2018)1<br>
        When, in the podcast, they are talking about the recovery of the German economy after the second world war, the reporter says: “Powered by Germany’s huge coal deposits and financed by American money, the German industry was soon humming.” But as we can see, this is, to put it nicely, an exaggeration.<br>
        <br>
        How much did German coal deposits contribute to the German post-war economic recovery?<br>
        “After WW2 coal mining played again a significant role in German socioeconomic history this time affording the so-called ‘economic miracle’.” (Aristizabal-H et al. 2023)2<br>
        No detailed information on why this was the case was provided by this source.<br>
        <br>
        What is the modern German economic model and where did it come from? <br>
        The German economic model has shifted, since Germany joined the eurozone in 1999, from being mainly driven by banks to being export-based. This is in part due to non-financial corporations increasingly financing their investments out of retained earnings instead of lending. (Braun & Deeg. 2019)3<br>
        This stands in contrast with the information given in the BBC podcast, where it seems as if a fairy tale about a German export-economy since 1945 is being told.<br>
        <br>
        Did Germany get lucky because of the eurozone crisis? <br>
        During the eurozone crisis in 2009, the German GDP dropped with 6.6 percentage points and did not recover until 2011.(Storm & Naastepad. 2015)4<br>
        When we listen to the BBC podcast, we are told, by the reporter again, that the eurozone crisis was like “a third lemon in a slot machine” for Germany. We could speculate and say that the eurozone crisis may have made it easier for German car producers to export their products to the United States. But that would probably not have such considerable effects on the German economy to say that the eurozone crisis can be seen as something good for the German economy.<br>
        <br>
        Is Germany dependent on exports?<br>
        While Germany is not completely dependent on exports, it is for sure a major part of its modern economic model. (Braun & Deeg. 2019)3<br>
        <u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u><br>
        ‘Is Germany OK?’ does not seem to have expert level information, despite experts being interviewed in the podcast. The reporter, who is obviously not an expert, makes a lot of bold statements whenever the experts are not talking, probably to make the podcast more interesting for the average listener. Also, due to there being a quite short time frame on the podcast, they have to make a lot of simplifications. But these two things negatively affect the overall credibility of the podcast. <br>

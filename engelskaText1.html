    <h1>1984 - An analysis</h1>
    <p>It is a common misconception that 1984’s primary focus is on mass surveillance. Maybe this is because people want to hide, or simply do not understand, the important but often uncomfortable truths that are portrayed almost satirically in this book. The principles of English socialism (ingsoc) and the ideology of the party is an exaggerated form of socialism where two contradictory truths can exist at the same time. For example, the party being the upholder of free speech in a world where free speech is impossible and illegal. To understand this complex paradox you need to either be completely stupid or exercise doublethink. Exercising doublethink means winning “an unending series of victories over your own memory”.<br><br></p>
    <p>1984 has shockingly many parallels to modern societies, and those parallels are not limited to dictatorships but can also be applied to democracies like Sweden. Phenomena like the absence of memory and doublethink are very interesting because they sometimes feel so familiar in the current political climate. Sometimes you might even feel like we might end up in the world of 1984 if society continues to develop like it does right now. Things like blindly trusting the ‘science’ sometimes requires either ignorance or doublethink.<br><br></p>
    <p>The absence of memory is portrayed brilliantly in the book and an example of that is when Oceania suddenly is at war with Eastasia and in an alliance with Eurasia and everyone forgets that Eurasia was the enemy and Eastasia was the ally just yesterday.<br><br></p>
    <p>The Swedish moderate party was the primary advocate of an open-border policy just a couple of years ago, but in the last election everyone seemed to have forgotten that and so people actually voted for the moderate party because they wanted less immigration.
        <br><br></p>
    <p>The Swedish Social Democratic party was in the beginning very pro-russian. In 1917 Hjalmar Branting greeted his ‘party friend’ Vladimir Lenin in Stockholm on his way back to Russia to take control over the communist revolution. Today however, people seem to think the social democrats have always understood the consequences of communism and have always been as distancing towards Russia as they are today.<br><br></p>
    <p>Although politics are a very important part of 1984, it is not only a book about politics, which I think is good because politics can get a bit boring and exhausting at times. The book also does a great job of describing certain personalities in a way that seems familiar and can be very funny. It also has a fair bit of romantic parts which really feel original in this book, unlike a disney movie.<br><br></p>
    <p>One thing I do not like about this book is that it is only in the very beginning that Winston Smith, the main character, seems to seriously be aware of how big brother is watching him. In the beginning it is very clear that not even a hair laid across the page-ends of Winston's diary can go undetected. But as the book progresses, Winston tries to push the boundaries and do more and more daring things. He even rents a room in one of the prole areas to avoid all the telescreens. But as expected there was a hidden telescreen in that room the whole time. The thought police eventually arrest him and it becomes apparent that they knew about him being a thought criminal the whole time.<br><br></p>
    <p>The last part of the book mostly revolves around Winston being tortured in the ministry of love and the book ends in a very interesting and different way: Winston gives up and becomes an NPC like everyone else in this dystopian society.<br><br></p>
    <p>To summarize I do not think that mass surveillance is the primary focus of 1984 because it contains so much more than that and if you really understand the concepts in this book, it can give you new perspectives on a lot of things in life and you will be able to draw a lot of interesting parallels to the real world. The book is very original and different. It has a satirical undertone which I think is an ingenious way to present complicated political and psychological concepts.<br><br></p>
